### RE-GNN

This is a demo of our proposed RE-GNN.

Modify the variable `datasetname` and execute `python preprocessor.py` to initialize the datasets.

Required datasets will be downloaded automatically.

We provide some commands in `script.sh` to help you reproduce some results we report in Table 3, 4 of the paper.
